# Strategy

QueryBuilder' goal is to provide the means of constructing a query string out form the current filter settings.

## User Needs
Users need to know which columns are sortable and define terms to filter them accordingly. Users might type slower than average so a debounced event handler is required, additional to that, the following are also User needs:

- easy and
- intuitive

### User Expectations
Users, and overall App Users expect Apps to be:

- reliable
- usable
- fast

## Business Objectives
Our goal with this exploration is that we come up with a working solution, a solution that we can then re-use among all of our projects.

- standardization
- reusability

# Success
Our success will be measured by how much code we save for developers to write as well as:

- no bugs
- performance
- stability
